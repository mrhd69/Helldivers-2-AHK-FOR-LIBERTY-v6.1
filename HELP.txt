How to Use. (Assuming you set up your Keyboard and Mouse ID useing Monitor provided in the file.)

1. Set all your keybinds. 
	Note: For StratMenu Key and Weapons key you will have to type in the key you want to use. 
		for example if you use control you would type control in the box. For the weapons
		key I recomend useing mouse buttons such as: xbutton1: Side mouse button
	        					     xbutton2:Side mouse button
							     mbutton: middle mouse button 
2. select your profile/Rename profile.
	Note: (Renaming is complety OPTIONAL, you can just leave them as profile 1-5 if you like) 
		When Renameing a profile first choose the profile you wish to rename then click the
		Rename Profile button you will be presented with a promt type what you want to name
		your profile.

3.Saveing Profiles.
	Note: When saveing your profile make sure have your profile selected and that you press
 		Start before saveing because start updates and set your keys into the script.
		Don't expect your keys to save if you don't do it!
		Also make sure ALL keybinds are set as this affects the saving order. 
		(not reffering to the Stratgem section Only KEYBINDS)

4.Changing Profile settings
	To change a saved profile setting Select the profile you wish to change, then press load, once
		loaded change whatever you want, just rember to press Start, Then Save.
	Note: You can easly switch Between profiles witout having to press start each time,
		just select a different profile and press load and your good.

Additional Recommendations
 After setting/saveing your keybinds for your first profile go ahead and select the next profile and save
	your keybinds there and for the rest of the pofiles to just so you dont have to typing them out 
	one by one.
